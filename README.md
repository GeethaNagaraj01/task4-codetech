OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

DEEP LEARNING PROJECT



Objective: The goal is to build a deep learning model that can classify images from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits (0-9), and your model will be trained to recognize and classify these images.

Dataset: You'll use the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, each 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

Model: The model will be built using TensorFlow/Keras and will consist of a few layers, including convolutional layers (for feature extraction) and fully connected layers (for classification).

Deliverables:

A functional deep learning model for image classification.
Visualizations to show the modelâ€™s training performance and final results, including:
Training and validation loss.
Training and validation accuracy.
Misclassified images.
Steps to Implement the Project
Setting up the Environment:

Install TensorFlow: pip install tensorflow
Import necessary libraries like TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Loading the MNIST Dataset:

Use tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist to load the dataset.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Preprocessing the Data:

Normalize the images to the range [0, 1] by dividing pixel values by 255.
Reshape the data if necessary, particularly for neural networks.
Convert the labels into one-hot encoded format using tf.keras.utils.to_categorical.
Building the Model:

Start with a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture:
Input layer (28x28 image).
A couple of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers.
Flatten the output to feed into fully connected layers.
Add a dense layer for the final classification (output layer with 10 neurons for each digit class).
Key Points to Keep in Mind:
Model Architecture: You can experiment with adding more layers or changing the number of neurons to improve accuracy.
Overfitting: Watch for overfitting by comparing training and validation accuracy. You can use techniques like dropout, data augmentation, or early stopping to combat overfitting.
Optimization: Try experimenting with different optimizers (SGD, RMSprop) or learning rates to see how they affect performance.
Visualization of Results:
Use graphs to show how well the model is performing during training and testing, and visualize the results of the predictions.
You can also visualize misclassified samples to understand the model's weaknesses.
